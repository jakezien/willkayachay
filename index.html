			<hr>
			<div class="brown-left">
				<p>The Q'eros people possess unique knowledge, from religion to farming to weaving. Yet their way of life is threatened. Many are migrating to urban areas for the sole purpose of educating their children. Families rarely return to the community after leaving. The Q'eros are striving to sustain their indigenous Andean identity in the face of outward migration, large-scale mining, globalization and the arrival of a road.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="brown-right">
				<p>Willka Yachay and community members identified culturally relevant primary and secondary education in Q'eros as the first step toward a sustainable future for their children and society.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>All of our projects are rooted in the United Nation's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples concerning their culture, identity, language, employment, health and education. The declaration "emphasizes the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations."</p>

The goal is to enable the next generation of Q'eros to become leaders who can guide their community toward sustainable modernity, elevating their standard of living while preserving their cultural identity.</p>

			<p>Willka Yachay coordinates all fundraising and programming for two community-based primary schools: Inkari, in the village of Ch'allma Chimpana, and Kusi Qoyllur, in Qocha Moqo. Qualified professors are teaching a combined total of forty children to read and write in both Quechua, their native tongue, and Spanish, and preparing them to interact with the modern world while preserving and nurturing their traditions. The warm-hearted and creative children are enjoying an innovative education that respects and cultivates their culture.</p>

			<h1>Ethnic High School</h1>
			<p>Willka Yachay's ethnic high school, or Colegio Etnico, in the village of Qocha Moqo, was founded in 2012 and is the first of its kind in Peru and perhaps in the world in that its curriculum is based on and nurtures a rich indigenous cultural heritage while teaching language and math skills through scientific, environmental and ethnographic projects. It is providing an education that will enable young Q'eros to go on to university, which none has ever done, and ultimately direct their community's future.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>The high school's director, Jes&uacute;s Rios Mencia, is a scientist with masters' degrees in mathematics and physics and the author of a book on Andean ancestral scientific and spiritual knowledge. He is deeply committed to indigenous rights and internationally recognized as a leader in culturally relevant education for indigenous populations.</p>

				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>Hannah Rae Porst's work in Q'eros began in 2010 when she lived among its people while researching the intersection of culture and development. During a community dinner on the eve of her departure she asked the village parents how she could thank them for their hospitality. There was some initial talk about soccer shoes, but what they really needed, they told her, was a school. While a senior in college, she raised funds, founded and helped build the first primary school in the Q'eros village of Ch'allma Chimpana. Hannah moved to Cusco in 2011 to continue work with the Q'eros. She and a colleague, Heidi Helena, established Willka Yachay, a Peruvian non-profit organization. Willka Yachay is Quechua for sacred knowledge. Hannah loves the Q'eros people and continues to learn much from them.</p>
