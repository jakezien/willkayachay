				<p>The Q&rsquo;eros people possess unique knowledge, from spiritual practices to farming to weaving. Yet their way of life is threatened. Many are migrating to urban areas for the sole purpose of educating their children. Families rarely return to the community after leaving. They have no health care, clean water or electricity. Food security is low. Child mortality is high. Q&rsquo;eros is a microcosm of the plight of native people worldwide as reported in the UN&rsquo;s State of the World&rsquo;s Indigenous Peoples.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="brown-right">
				<p>The Q&rsquo;eros are striving to sustain their indigenous Andean identity in the face of outward migration, large-scale mining, globalization and the arrival of a road. Willka Yachay and community members identified culturally relevant primary and secondary education in Q&rsquo;eros as the first step toward a sustainable future for their children and society.</p>

						<h1>Ethnic High School</h1>
						<p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s ethnic high school, or Colegio Etnico, was founded in 2012 in the village of Qocha Moqo. The school is the first of its kind in Peru, and perhaps in the world, in that its curriculum is based on and nurtures a rich indigenous cultural heritage, while also teaching language and math skills through scientific, environmental, and ethnographic projects. It provides an education that will enable young Q&rsquo;eros to go on to university, which none has ever done, and ultimately direct their community&rsquo;s future.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>The high school&rsquo;s director, Jes&uacute;s Rios Mencia, is a scientist with masters&rsquo; degrees in mathematics and physics and the author of a book on Andean ancestral scientific and spiritual knowledge. He is deeply committed to indigenous rights and internationally recognized as a leader in culturally relevant education for indigenous populations.</p>

				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>Hannah Rae Porst&rsquo;s work in Q&rsquo;eros began in 2010 when she lived among its people while researching the intersection of culture and development. During a community dinner on the eve of her departure she asked the village parents how she could thank them for their hospitality. There was some initial talk about soccer shoes, but what they really needed, they told her, was a school. While a senior in college, she raised funds for, founded, and helped build the first primary school in the Q&rsquo;eros village of Ch&rsquo;allma Chimpana. Hannah moved to Cusco in 2011 to continue work with the Q&rsquo;eros. She and a colleague, Heidi Helena, established Willka Yachay, a Peruvian non-profit organization. Willka Yachay is Quechua for sacred knowledge. Hannah loves the Q&rsquo;eros people and continues to learn much from them.</p>
